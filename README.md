Introduction to Basic HTML & HTML5

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a markup language used to describe the structure of a web page. It uses a special syntax or notation to organize and give information about the page to the browser. Elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content. For example, there are different tag options to place around text to show whether it is a heading, a paragraph, or a list.

Top level heading: Maybe a page title

A paragraph of text. Some information we would like to communicate to the user. This can be as long or short as we would like.

    Number one on the list
    Number two
    A third item

The HyperText part of HTML comes from the early days of the web and its original use case. Pages usually contained static documents that contained references to other documents. These references contained hypertext links used by the browser to navigate to the reference document so the user could read the reference document without having to manually search for it.

As web pages and web applications grow more complex, the W3 Consortium updates the HTML specification to ensure that a webpage can be shown reliably on any browser. The latest version of HTML is HTML5.

This section introduces how to use HTML elements to give structure and meaning to your web content.


Introduction to Basic CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) tell the browser how to display the text and other content that you write in HTML.

Note that CSS is case-sensitive so be careful with your capitalization. CSS has been adopted by all major browsers and allows you to control:

    color
    fonts
    positioning
    spacing
    sizing
    decorations
    transitions

There are three main ways to apply CSS styling. You can apply inline styles directly to HTML elements with the style attribute. Alternatively, you can place CSS rules within style tags in an HTML document. Finally, you can write CSS rules in an external style sheet, then reference that file in the HTML document. Even though the first two options have their use cases, most developers prefer external style sheets because they keep the styles separate from the HTML elements. This improves the readability and reusability of your code. The idea behind CSS is that you can use a selector to target an HTML element in the DOM (Document Object Model) and then apply a variety of attributes to that element to change the way it is displayed on the page.

In this section, you'll see how adding CSS styles to the elements of your CatPhotoApp can change it from simple text to something more.
